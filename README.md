Enhancing Electric Vehicle Speed Prediction using Recurrent Neural Network-based Hybrid Model (LSTM-ARIMA)

In the last decade, there has been increased effort by governments, international 
organizations, and citizens towards sustainable development most notably in 
the energy field. The growth this year has been notable especially in the EV 
segment and the investments also have been in green energy technology. This 
makes the use of EVs to be viewed as a suitable approach discharging 
greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. Because of the impact of various factors 
and driving dynamics of the car, the rate of EV speeds is not very easy to 
determine, thereby making it difficult to predict power demands. 
This study seeks to overcome these challenges by using a Recurrent Neural 
Network (RNN) with a hybrid of the recurrent and convolutional approaches to 
estimate the EV speeds. The hybrid RNN model is compared with LSTM 
algorithm. Another type of electric vehicles called Battery Electric Vehicles or 
BEVs, which became popular because of their environmental merits, and decent 
range, that can range from 90 up to 500 kilometres. The driving range can be 
seen to be mainly influenced by battery capacity which is generally expensive. 
Hence, the way to efficiently enhance driving range without changing battery 
capacity is the optimization of total lost power without hurting driver comfort. 
This study draws its chief objective from the existence of related studies seeking 
to determine a high-performing blended RNN algorithm for the prediction of 
EV speeds above standalone models. These include identification and designing 
of the appropriate RNN hybrid model, deployment of the identified model and 
the assessment of the usefulness of the model by testing it against the whole 
trajectory (WT) and segment trajectory (ST) datasets. The scope of the 
assessment is restricted to datasets gathered from Battery-powered Electric 
Vehicles (BEVs) using Twizy EVs on urban roads in the RSK region before. 
In proposing the RNN hybrid model, the research aims to establish key findings 
regarding design, performance, and evaluation. More precisely, it is focused on 
identification of how the appropriate RNN hybrid model should be formed, 
what model provides the highest performance, and how the proposed model 
could be evaluated effectively. 
In summary, this investigation not only improves the theoretical comprehension 
of hybrid RNN models, but also offers the reference value for constructing more 
effective the EVs.
